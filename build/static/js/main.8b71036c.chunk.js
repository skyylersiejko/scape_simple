It's Free to build and play. Scape was created because we felt like Magic was becoming too unstable and bloated; Magic, Hearthstone, and most TCG(s) are just too large by way of change due to market driven goals. I wanted to rebuild an engine that was hyper competitive and could support complex, but fair gameplay without the need for a pay wall. As we play-tested this game we realized just how much more efficient, complex, and overall fun Scape started to become. We found ourselves wanting to play Scape more than Magic. Another incredible aspect of Scape is that, while the deck doesn't change, the rituals and actions do. In other words: we will release new rituals to perform in the game as the development of the game progresses. Instead of having a prerelease weekend for new cards; we will have release events for new Rituals. we see Ritual based gameplay as the next evolution of competitive card games. The Scape model is more focused on competition gameplay and is built to support a tournament enviroment.
